\section{Proof Systems}

\begin{mfai-box}{Proof Systems Overview}{shield-alt}
The \mfaiprotocol{Proof Systems} are the core mechanisms that enable \mfaibuilder{builders} to demonstrate their skills, vision, and commitment within the \mfaiprotocol{Cognitive Activation Protocol}. These systems create verifiable credentials that unlock access to protocol features and benefits.
\end{mfai-box}

\subsection{Proof-of-Skill™}

\begin{mfai-box-learn}{Skill Verification System}{graduation-cap}
\mfaiprotocol{Proof-of-Skill} is the primary credential that verifies a \mfaibuilder{builder}'s technical and cognitive capabilities in Web3 development and entrepreneurship.
\end{mfai-box-learn}

Key aspects of \mfaiprotocol{Proof-of-Skill} include:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \mfaihighlight{Skill Verification}: Comprehensive assessment of technical abilities
\item \mfaihighlight{Project Portfolio}: Evidence of practical implementation
\item \mfaihighlight{Knowledge Validation}: Confirmation of theoretical understanding
\item \mfaihighlight{Continuous Learning}: Ongoing skill development tracking
\item \mfaihighlight{Expertise Recognition}: Acknowledgment of specialized capabilities
\end{itemize}

\begin{tblr}{colspec={|X[0.45]|X[0.45]|}, hlines}
\textbf{Skill Level} & \textbf{Benefits} \\
Novice & Basic protocol access \\
Intermediate & Enhanced features and Cognitive Lock™ \\
Advanced & Full governance rights \\
Expert & Premium tools and priority access \\
Master & Protocol leadership opportunities \\
\end{tblr}

\subsection{Proof-of-Vision™}

\begin{mfai-box-build}{Vision Verification System}{lightbulb}
\mfaiprotocol{Proof-of-Vision} validates a \mfaibuilder{builder}'s ability to identify opportunities and develop innovative solutions in the Web3 space.
\end{mfai-box-build}

\mfaiprotocol{Proof-of-Vision} encompasses:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \mfaihighlight{Market Analysis}: Understanding of market dynamics
\item \mfaihighlight{Innovation Potential}: Capacity for creative problem-solving
\item \mfaihighlight{Strategic Planning}: Long-term vision development
\item \mfaihighlight{Value Proposition}: Clear articulation of benefits
\item \mfaihighlight{Impact Assessment}: Evaluation of potential outcomes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proof Pass™}

\begin{mfai-box-prove}{Unified Access System}{ticket-alt}
\mfaiprotocol{Proof Pass} is the unified credential that combines \mfaiprotocol{Proof-of-Skill} and \mfaiprotocol{Proof-of-Vision}, granting access to advanced protocol features and opportunities.
\end{mfai-box-prove}

\mfaiprotocol{Proof Pass} provides:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \mfaihighlight{Protocol Access}: Entry to advanced features
\item \mfaihighlight{Resource Allocation}: Priority access to resources
\item \mfaihighlight{Governance Rights}: Participation in \mfaiprotocol{Synaptic Governance}
\item \mfaihighlight{Network Benefits}: Access to builder network
\item \mfaihighlight{Recognition}: Status within the ecosystem
\end{itemize}

    \node[mfai-node] (pass) at (8,0) {\mfaiprotocol{Proof Pass}\\\textcolor{solana-purple}{Unified Access}};

    \draw[mfai-arrow] (skill) -- (pass);
    \draw[mfai-arrow] (vision) -- (pass);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\subsection{Value Creation and Distribution}

The Proof Systems create and distribute value through:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \textbf{Skill Verification}: On-chain validation of capabilities
\item \textbf{Value Recognition}: Tokenization of achievements
\item \textbf{Access Control}: Feature and benefit unlocking
\item \textbf{Governance Rights}: Decision-making power
\item \textbf{Reward Distribution}: Neuro-Dividends™ allocation
\end{itemize}

\begin{mfai-box-scale}{Future Development}{rocket}
The \mfaiprotocol{Proof Systems} are continuously evolving to incorporate new validation methods and recognition mechanisms. Our team is dedicated to enhancing these systems to better serve the needs of \mfaibuilder{builders} and maintain the highest standards of verification.
