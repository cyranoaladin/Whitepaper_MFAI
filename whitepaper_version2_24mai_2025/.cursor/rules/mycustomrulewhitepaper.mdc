Money Factory AI — Full Protocol Narrative & LaTeX Structuring Rules  
This rule ensures every part of the whitepaper follows the official narrative, terminology, formatting and structuring rules of the MFAI project.

.rules:

# 📚 General Narrative
- This is not a platform. It is a **living Web3 protocol**. Always say “protocol”, not “platform”.
- Always use: **“The Cognitive Activation Protocol™”** in full where relevant.
- Mention that we are in **pre-TGE phase** and the protocol is **under construction** by a dedicated team.
- The protocol enables builders to go from **skill to sovereignty** through proof-based activation.
- Never use the term "user". Always replace with “builder”, “sovereign actor”, or “entrepreneur”.
- Each section must reflect our mission to train, certify and launch post-Web2 entrepreneurs.
- Avoid all references to NFT unless strictly necessary — use “Proof-of-Skill Token™”, “Pass”, or “verifiable credential” instead.

# 🔀 Terminology Table (Mandatory)
| ❌ Forbidden | ✅ Replace with |
|-------------|----------------|
| user        | builder / actor / entrepreneur |
| NFT         | Proof-of-Skill Token™ / Pass™ |
| DAO         | Synaptic Governance™ |
| staking     | Cognitive Lock™ |
| certificate | Proof-of-Skill™ |
| assistant   | AI Co-Founder™ |
| edtech      | cognitive protocol |
| airdrop     | Neuro-Dividends™ |

All custom concepts must be introduced with `™` at first mention in each section.

# 🧱 Whitepaper Structure (Required Order)
1. Executive Summary  
2. Problem Statement  
3. Vision & Narrative  
4. Cognitive Activation Protocol™ (5+1 loop)  
5. Zyno AI Co-Founder™ (AEPO™, AECO™, RAG-Gov™, Zyno Pro™)  
6. Proof Systems (Proof-of-Skill™, Proof-of-Vision™, Proof Pass™)  
7. Synaptic Governance™  
8. $MFAI Token Utility  
9. Burn / Buyback / Circular Economy  
10. Business Model  
11. Roadmap  
12. Team, Legal, Disclaimer  
13. Glossary

# ✍️ Writing Style & Voice
- Prefer short, precise, active-voice sentences.
- Prioritize clarity and progressivity (each section must logically build on the previous).
- Avoid full-caps and aggressive styles.
- Use `\textbf{}`, `\textit{}` meaningfully (no style flooding).
- Each concept must be defined before use via a `\begin{mfai-box}` when appropriate.

# 🎨 Layout & Code Styling
- All diagrams use TikZ. Keep symmetry, label all nodes clearly.
- Use gradient colors from Solana palette:
    - `solana-purple`: #9945FF
    - `solana-green`: #14F195
- Apply alternated tones to boxes when showing protocol phases (Learn, Build, Prove, Activate, Scale).
- Use `\begin{mfai-box}[Definition: Term]{icon}` to define each MFAI concept.

# 🧾 LaTeX Structure Rules
- main.tex compiles sections/*.tex
- mfai.sty holds all colors, boxes, commands
- Always use:
```latex
\usepackage{tikz}
\usepackage{tabularray}
\usepackage{enumitem}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\usepackage{titlesec}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{hyperref}
