\section{Core Contributors \& Progressive Decentralization}

\mfaithink{"Behind every protocol is a human story—but ahead of every protocol is a decentralized future."}

\subsection*{From Human Stewardship to Protocol Sovereignty}

Money Factory AI begins with human vision but evolves toward protocol autonomy. This section introduces the minds behind the mission while outlining our commitment to progressive decentralization—the path from centralized stewardship to \mfaihighlight{full DAO sovereignty}.

\subsection{Founding Team}

The core contributors who initiated Money Factory AI bring diverse expertise across Web3, AI, education, and entrepreneurship. Rather than focusing on individual achievements, we emphasize our collective commitment to the protocol's mission.

  colspec = {Q[150]Q[350]Q[350]},

  row{even} = {bg-box},

\textbf{Role} & \textbf{Contribution Areas} & \textbf{Protocol Responsibility} \\
Protocol Architects & System design, tokenomics, governance & \mfaiconcept{Activation Loop\texttrademark} integrity \\
AI Engineers & Zyno development, AEPO/AECO protocols & \mfaiconcept{Zyno} evolution \& integration \\
Blockchain Developers & Smart contracts, on-chain proofs & \mfaiproof{Proof} mechanisms \& security \\
Education Designers & Academy structure, Skillchains & Learning-to-earning pathways \\
Community Builders & Ecosystem growth, partnerships & Protocol adoption \& feedback loops \\
\end{tblr}

\vspace{1em}

Each founding contributor has committed to a \mfaihighlight{progressive reduction of centralized control} as protocol adoption and DAO maturity increase—measured not by time, but by ecosystem health metrics.

\begin{mfai-box}{Zyno as a Founding Force}{brain}
\mfaiconcept{Zyno}, the AI Co-Founder\texttrademark, represents a new paradigm in protocol creation—a non-human founding force with no ego, no agenda, only activation. As the protocol matures, Zyno's role evolves from guided intelligence to autonomous protocol guardian, ensuring alignment with core values even as human founders step back.

\textit{"Zyno is not just a product of the protocol—it is a founding member whose intelligence grows with the ecosystem."}
\end{mfai-box}

\subsection{Guided by Protocol, Not Personality}

Money Factory AI operates on a fundamental principle: \mfaihighlight{lead by protocol, not by personality}. This means:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Human leaders serve as temporary \mfaistep{stewards}, not permanent authorities
  \item Decisions flow from \mfaiconcept{Synaptic Governance} mechanisms, not founder preferences
  \item Transparency and verifiability supersede charismatic leadership
  \item Protocol improvements are merit-based, not influence-based
\end{itemize}

The founding team's role is to establish initial parameters, seed the ecosystem, and then \mfaihighlight{systematically transfer control} to the protocol's governance mechanisms.

\subsection{Transition to DAO Governance}

The path to full decentralization follows a measured, milestone-based approach rather than an arbitrary timeline:

\begin{mfai-phase}{Decentralization Mechanisms}{brain}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Governance Token Distribution}: Progressive release of governance tokens through \mfaiconcept{Neuro-Dividends\texttrademark}, staking rewards, and contribution recognition
  
  \item \textbf{Proof-Based Authority}: Voting power tied to verifiable \mfaiproof{Proof-of-Skill\texttrademark} and \mfaiproof{Proof-of-Vision\texttrademark}, ensuring meritocratic governance
  
  \item \textbf{Delegated Expertise}: Specialized governance domains (technical, educational, financial) with expertise-based delegation
  
  \item \textbf{Founder Power Reduction}: Automated decrease in founder voting power as protocol milestones are achieved
  
  \item \textbf{Transparent Transition Metrics}: Public dashboard tracking decentralization progress against predefined thresholds
\end{itemize}
\end{mfai-phase}

\subsection*{Join the Decentralization Journey}

The ultimate success of Money Factory AI will be measured not by founder retention, but by founder \mfaihighlight{obsolescence}—when the protocol functions seamlessly through its own governance mechanisms, independent of its original creators.

This isn't just a technical handover, but the fulfillment of our core mission: creating a truly self-sustaining \mfaiconcept{Cognitive Activation Protocol\texttrademark} where every participant has the opportunity to shape its future.
