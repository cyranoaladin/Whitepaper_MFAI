\section{Cognitive Passes \& Subscription Model}

\subsection{Three Levels of Access}
Money Factory AI's \mfaiconcept{Cognitive Passes} are dynamic, on-chain activation identifiers that determine each member's access, engagement, and evolution within the protocol. There are three progressive levels:\\
\textbf{Gold:} Entry-level access to core modules (Zyno Basic, Academy, DAO participation), simplified staking, and eligibility for community rewards.\\
\textbf{Platinum:} Unlocks Zyno coaching, priority on DAO proposals, and the ability to review \mfaiproof{Proof-of-Vision} submissions.\\
\textbf{Diamond:} Grants mentorship privileges, access to incubation programs, extended DAO rights, and early entry to the Launchpad.

\subsection{Utility \& Rewards}
Each Pass is both a cognitive identifier and a merit revealer:\\
- Unlocks protocol modules and features according to level.\\
- Enables staking for rewards and governance influence.\\
- Higher tiers gain access to coaching, mentorship, and privileged governance roles.\\
- \mfaistep{Community rewards}, \mfaistep{priority access}, and \mfaistep{exclusive events} are distributed based on Pass status and engagement.

\subsection{Upgrade \& Dynamic Features}
\mfaiconcept{Cognitive Passes} are designed to evolve:\\
- Members can upgrade their Pass via \mfaiproof{Proof-of-Skill}, staking, or active DAO contributions.\\
- Upgrading triggers a burn/reward mechanism, reinforcing scarcity and merit.\\
- \mfaistep{Quests}, \mfaistep{challenges}, and \mfaistep{community events} are directly linked to Pass evolution and unlocks.

\subsection{Gamification \& Loyalty Mechanics}
The protocol weaves gamification into its access model:\\
- \mfaistep{Progression} is narrative and participatory, not transactional.\\
- \mfaistep{Loyalty} is rewarded through engagement, not just holding.\\
- \mfaistep{Dynamic upgrades} and \mfaistep{community quests} foster a sense of belonging and achievement.
